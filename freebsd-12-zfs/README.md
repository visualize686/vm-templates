## Notes:

This Developer-centric VM contains the basic binary distribution of FreeBSD 12 (-current) on a ZFS root filesystem, as well as basic developer tools like Python and Ruby.  The /usr/src and /usr/ports trees are checked out from github, are current as of the time this template was created, and can be updated with git (also installed).
