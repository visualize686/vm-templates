## Notes:

This VM contains a SmartOS build:20160915T211220Z VM working on UEFI CSM bootrom.
System is booting from a CDROM device, although it also contains DISK device
storing rest of installed system and user data. Because of such configuration
CDROM device should not be ever removed.

SmartOS prints first part of boot messages into other console,
so please be patient on initial blank screen in main console.
